                                   <p>They include less vigor, light green to yellow-green leaves, less vegetative growth and low yields, as seen in the accompanying picture.
                                     While low N can be a problem for most species of tree fruit, excessive N can be equally bad. Young, non-bearing trees will often benefit more from higher N programs than older bearing trees.
                                      The goal with young trees is to produce wood and vegetative growth, while the goal with bearing trees is strong yields of high quality fruit..</p>

                                   <h3>FOR GROWTH</h3>
                                   <p>The N requirement of apples can be generally related to the amount of wood in the trees.
                                     In other words, larger trees generally require a higher N program than dwarf trees.</p>

                               </div>

                                   <h3>PRUNING</h3>
                                   <p>Heavily pruned trees generally require less N. This relates to the lower amount of wood and foliage present to utilize the N, and the higher “root to shoot” ratio after pruning.</p>

                                   <h3>DENSITY OF TREE</h3>
                                   <p>As a general rule, more trees per acre means more N required. However, where higher populations are coupled with strongly dwarfed varieties, and severe pruning (such as “hedgerow” planting), the grower may find that the N rate required for optimum leaf N levels may not differ significantly from lower populations.</p>

                                   <h3>JUDGING N STATUS VISUALLY</h3>
                                   <p>The most desirable nitrogen management program provides a relatively high N status early in the season to encourage rapid leaf development, fruit set, and flower bud formation, but permits N to decline gradually as the season progresses. This tends to enhance favor, fruit color, and tree hardening. The following factors can be used to evaluate apple N status, but none will substitute for annual leaf analysis.</p>

                               </div>

                                <h3>COLOR OF FRUIT</h3>
                                <p>In bearing-age trees, fruit color development is delayed when N levels are too high. If other factors are equal, the percentage of red color is reduced by about 5% for each 0.1% increase in leaf N,
                                     This relationship is particularly significant with less highly colored fruit varieties or strains.
                                     Yellowing of Golden Delicious fruit shows a similar reduction as leaf N increases.</p>

                                <h3>FIRMNESS AND FRUIT SIZE</h3>
                                <p>These are usually inversely related, and both are influenced by N status. Size generally increases with higher N levels, if the crop load is not excessive, and this tends to result in less firm fruit flesh.</p>

                                <h3>COLOR AND FIRMNESS</h3>
                                <p>Differences in fruit coloring and/or flesh firmness are also a guide in evaluating N status. Soft varieties and apple crops intended for fresh market (eating apples) have a lower optimum N content than those that are bred to be harder, or are intended for processing.</p>

                                <h3>TERMINAL GROWTH</h3>
                                <p>Nitrogen is also the major nutrient factor influencing the higher N uptake encourages the tree to produce longer annual terminal growth. This is desirable in new plantings, but not in established, bearing trees. Sufficient vigor is also indicated by annual terminal growth of 8 – 12 inches for non-spur varieties, and 6 – 8 inches for spur varieties.</p>
